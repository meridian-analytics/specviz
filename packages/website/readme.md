# @meridiancfi/specviz-website

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a static website generator.

### Installation

```sh
$ bun install
```

This command installs the development dependencies.

### Local Development

```sh
$ bun run dev
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```sh
$ bun run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

```sh
$ bun run deploy
```

This command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.
